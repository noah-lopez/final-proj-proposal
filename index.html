        <h4 align="middle">Summary  </h4>
        <p align="middle"> You wake up in a prison tower on an abandoned planet. <br> In order to escape, you must progress up through randomized levels all the way to the top of the tower. <br> At the top of the tower is a spaceship which you pilot to shoot baddies and escape the planet. </p>

        <h4 align="middle">Problem Description </h4>
        <p align="middle"> We wish to design a game that is optimized for web browsers (and mobile?), with reasonable AI for the non-player characters as well as randomization of levels such that each playthrough is unique.

		In this regard, WebGL provides a good framework to build games (in either 2D or 3D) that load quickly on browser and can be made for mobile as well. WebGL is built on top of JavaScript and GLSL, which from Project 3-2 we know loads quickly and processes shaders quickly as well. The main challenges then are designing the AI and the levels, 1. So that they work, and 2. That they are randomized to a reasonable degree.
 		</p>

 		<h4 align="middle"> Goals and Deliverables </h4>
        <p align="middle"> 1) We will deliver a fully functional game. However, we expect the quality of 3D models, and length of the game to possibly be somewhat lacking. At the very least, assets and levels load, and the player should be able to interact with the world (e.g. fight bad guys, pick up items, etc).<br>

		2) We hope to deliver a fully functional game with a wide variety of game modes, many levels and beautiful 3D models. In particular, we hope to implement both the dungeon/prison portion and the spaceship shooter portion, with working controls and proper interaction.

 		</p>

 		<h4 align="middle"> Schedule </h4>
        <p align="middle"> Each week we will meet up twice once during the week for 1.5 hours and once on the weekend for another 1.5. During the first meeting we <br>will divide a weeks goal into tasks and start them together. During the second we help each other complete unfinished tasks.<br><br>

		Week 1 Goal: Design front end. Sketch wireframes build basic 3D models etc.<br>
		Week 2 Goal: Build games backend. Gameplay mechanics i.e. implement controls etc. <br>
		Week 3 Goal: Refine backend and frontend.<br>
		Week 4 Goal: Work on poster and video. <br>
